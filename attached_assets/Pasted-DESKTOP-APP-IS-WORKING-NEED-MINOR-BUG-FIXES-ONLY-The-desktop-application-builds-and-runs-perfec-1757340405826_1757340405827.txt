DESKTOP APP IS WORKING - NEED MINOR BUG FIXES ONLY

The desktop application builds and runs perfectly! Login works, data displays correctly, and core functionality is operational. However, there are several minor issues that need fixing WITHOUT breaking the working desktop build.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT modify the Electron build process, main.cjs, or package.json scripts. These are working perfectly.**

## ISSUES TO FIX:

### 1. PRINT FUNCTIONALITY
**Issue**: Clicking print buttons redirects to "You'll need an app to open this link"
**Fix Needed**: Implement proper print functionality for desktop environment using window.print() or electron print APIs

### 2. EXPORT DATA INCONSISTENCY  
**Issue**: Export button on main dashboard does nothing (only logs "Export Data"), but works fine in Reports section
**Fix Needed**: Make dashboard export button functional - should match the working Reports export behavior

### 3. DASHBOARD FUNCTIONALITY FIXES
**Issues**:
- Goal progress bars not working/updating
- All percentage changes show "+0.0%" instead of real calculations  
- Month filter dropdown not filtering data by selected time range
- Quick action buttons (Add Sale, Add Product, etc.) not responding

**Fix Needed**: 
- Calculate real percentage changes (current vs previous period)
- Implement goal progress calculation and display
- Make time range filters actually filter the displayed data
- Connect quick action buttons to their respective functions

### 4. PROFIT CALCULATION VERIFICATION
**Question**: Confirm if displayed profit = revenue - expenses OR just gross profit without expense deduction
**Fix Needed**: Ensure profit shows net profit (revenue - cost_of_goods - expenses) for accurate business metrics

### 5. SALES EDITING CAPABILITY
**Issue**: Cannot edit sales records after creation
**Fix Needed**: Add edit functionality for sales entries (quantity, price, etc.) with proper Excel update

### 6. DATA STORAGE CLARIFICATION
**Question**: Where is data stored in desktop app - still in Excel file or different location?
**Fix Needed**: Ensure consistent Excel-based storage for desktop version

### 7. SEARCH/FILTER IMPROVEMENTS
**Issue**: Limited filtering options across products, sales, expenses
**Fix Needed**: Add search bars and filter options:
- Products: Filter by category, name, stock level
- Sales: Filter by date range, product, customer  
- Expenses: Filter by category, date range, amount

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

**PRESERVE WORKING FUNCTIONALITY:**
- Do NOT modify Electron configuration
- Do NOT change build scripts or processes  
- Do NOT alter server startup logic
- Do NOT break existing login/data display

**FOCUS ON UI/UX FIXES:**
- Fix existing broken buttons and calculations
- Add missing filter functionality
- Improve data editing capabilities
- Enhance search and navigation

**TESTING PRIORITY:**
- Test each fix individually
- Ensure desktop build still works after changes
- Verify Excel data integration remains intact

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:

After fixes:
- All dashboard buttons work properly
- Real percentage calculations display  
- Time filters actually filter data
- Print functionality works in desktop
- Sales can be edited after creation
- Search/filter options available throughout app
- Export works from all locations consistently

**IMPORTANT: These are minor UI/functionality fixes for an already working application. Please implement carefully to maintain the current stable desktop build.**
