Hello Replit AI,

This is a comprehensive brief to solve the final, critical bug in my Shop Analytics Desktop App. Please read this entire document carefully. My goal is to produce a working desktop application installer from the existing GitHub Actions workflow.

Part 1: Current Project Status
 Build Configuration (package.json): Manually Corrected by Me
After the application bugs were fixed, I tried to build the app on my local PC. I encountered numerous build errors which I solved myself through extensive debugging. These fixes are already in the package.json file. You do not need to change the build configuration.

The problems I solved myself include:

An Invalid configuration object error for an unknown electronRebuild property, which I removed.

An Invalid configuration object error for an unknown signing property, which I corrected to forceCodeSigning: false.

A runtime crash (Cannot find module 'electron-store') in the built app, which I fixed by adding "package.json" to the "files" array in the build config.

The build process hanging due to a massive (565+ MB) app size, which I fixed by refining the "files" array to explicitly ignore node_modules.

Part 2: The Final, Unsolved Problem
Despite all of my fixes, the build still failed on both Replit (due to disk quota limits) and my local PC (due to antivirus file locking). To solve this, a previous AI created a GitHub Actions workflow.

Current State:

The GitHub Actions workflow succeeds. It runs without errors and produces a downloadable .exe installer.

The downloaded .exe file installs and runs correctly.

However, when I try to activate the app with a valid Gumroad license key, it fails with the error: "Cannot verify license. Check internet connection."

What I Know for Sure:

My internet connection is working perfectly.

The Gumroad license key is 100% correct.

Therefore, the problem is not my key or my internet. The issue is that the final, packaged Electron application is being blocked from making the network request to the Gumroad API.

The last attempt to fix this involved adding the electron-log library to create a log file for debugging, but after building and running this version, no log file was created, which is very strange.

Part 3: Your Task - Fix the Network and Logging in the Packaged App
Your only task is to fix the underlying issue that prevents the final, built .exe from successfully communicating with https://api.gumroad.com and to ensure that the logging works correctly.

Please investigate and implement a robust solution. The problem is likely one of the following:

Electron's Content Security Policy (CSP): This is the most probable cause. The main process (electron/main.cjs) needs to be configured with a proper CSP that explicitly allows the connect-src directive for https://api.gumroad.com. The current security settings in the packaged app are likely too restrictive.

Logging Failure: The fact that electron-log did not create a file suggests a fundamental issue. The application might be crashing silently before the logger can initialize, or it lacks the necessary permissions in
