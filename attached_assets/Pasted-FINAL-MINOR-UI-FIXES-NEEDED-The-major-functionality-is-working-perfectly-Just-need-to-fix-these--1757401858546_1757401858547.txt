FINAL MINOR UI FIXES NEEDED

The major functionality is working perfectly! Just need to fix these last few UI issues:

## REMAINING ISSUES:

### 1. CHART DOWNLOAD BUTTONS NOT WORKING
**Issue**: Download buttons on Revenue and Sales by Category charts only log to console, don't actually download
**Fix Needed**: Implement actual chart download functionality (PNG/PDF export) instead of console.log

### 2. REVENUE CHART DATE RANGE SELECTOR
**Issue**: Date range buttons on the revenue chart aren't functional 
**Fix Needed**: Connect the chart's date range buttons to actually filter the revenue chart data

### 3. DASHBOARD CUSTOM DATE FILTER
**Issue**: Month filter dropdown works for preset ranges, but custom date picker doesn't update the data
**Fix Needed**: Ensure custom date range selection triggers data refresh on dashboard

### 4. DESKTOP PRINT FUNCTIONALITY
**Issue**: Print works in browser (npm run dev) but shows "You'll need an app to open this link" in desktop app
**Fix Needed**: Implement Electron-specific print handling using ipcRenderer or window.electronAPI for desktop environment

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

**For Chart Downloads:**
- Use chart library's built-in export features (recharts/canvas export)
- Generate PNG or PDF files and trigger browser download

**For Desktop Print:**
- Detect Electron environment: `window.navigator.userAgent.includes('Electron')`
- Use Electron's print API instead of window.print() for desktop
- May need to expose print function in preload.js

**For Custom Date Range:**
- Ensure date picker onChange event calls the same API update as dropdown filter
- Verify date format compatibility with backend

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Chart download buttons generate and download actual files
- Revenue chart date buttons filter the chart data  
- Custom date picker updates all dashboard data
- Print works in both browser and desktop app

These are very minor fixes for an otherwise fully functional business application.
